Description
-----------
A program that encrypt/ decrypt files or information using 
certain keys and pass phrases. pass phrases are masked with keys 
to create mask, that will  encrypt/decrypt the data provided. 
Encrypt/decrypted will be written to stdout

How to compile
--------------
To compile this program, simply navigate to the directory containing the
source files for PA2 (which should include the Makefile) and type 'make'.

How to run
----------
To run the program, type the executable name followed by the input
arguments.  For example:

	./mycrypt - for stdin input or ./mycrypt filename for file input

Normal output
-------------
    Normal output is printed to stdout.  An example of normal 
    output would be
    the following, whereas stdout is redirected:

[cs30xds@ieng9]:pa2:580$ ./mycrypt test > test4.encrypted
Enter the passphrase [at least 8 chars]: Hello World
Enter the two 32-bit keys [octal, decimal, or hex]
        separated by a space or tab: 075242 0xdeadbeef
Enter the rotation key [-63 <-> +63]: 19


Abnormal output
---------------
    Abnormal output is printed to stderr.  This can occur if the 
    inputs is not a
    number, out of certain range, less than 8 characters, 
    or out of bounds

[cs30xds@ieng9]:pa2:532$ ./mycrypt - > test
Enter the passphrase [at least 8 chars]: Hi

        Passphrase must be at least 8 chars long; Try again.

Enter the passphrase [at least 8 chars]: Hi There
Enter the two 32-bit keys [octal, decimal, or hex]
        separated by a space or tab: 14

        Only 1 key entered. You must enter 2 keys.

Enter the two 32-bit keys [octal, decimal, or hex]
        separated by a space or tab: ln4 abc

        "ln4" is not an integer


        "abc" is not an integer

Enter the two 32-bit keys [octal, decimal, or hex]
        separated by a space or tab: 14 999999999999999999999999

        Converting "999999999999999999999999" base "0": Result too large

Enter the two 32-bit keys [octal, decimal, or hex]
        separated by a space or tab: 14 098

        "098" is not an integer

Enter the two 32-bit keys [octal, decimal, or hex]
        separated by a space or tab: 14 0xfgh

        "0xfgh" is not an integer

Enter the two 32-bit keys [octal, decimal, or hex]
        separated by a space or tab: 14 0xabcdef
Enter the rotation key [-63 <-> +63]: -99

        Rotation key must be within the range of [-63 <-> 63]

Enter the rotation key [-63 <-> +63]: 64

        Rotation key must be within the range of [-63 <-> 63]

Enter the rotation key [-63 <-> +63]: ^D
[cs30xds@ieng9]:pa2:532$

This can also occur if there are too little arguments:

[cs30xds@ieng9]:pa2:586$ ./mycrypt

        Usage: ./mycrypt filename | -


Testing
-------
This program was tested using the sample pa2test executable 
that was provided. Both programs were run with the same input and 
their outputs were redirected to two different files.  These outputs 
were then compared using the command line tool 'diff'.  
When there were no differences in output, it indicated that my 
program was functioning properly.

Furthermore, all of the other methods were individually tested, 
using unit test methods, implementing various test cases, with edges
along error possibilities making sure it does its job correctly
